Q4.Write a short note on Tag and element with an example.
Ans.
Tag:

structure of a specific element on a webpage. Tags are used to instruct the web browser how to display the
content they enclose. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag, with the name of the
element enclosed within the tags.
Element:

distinct part of a webpage's content or structure. Elements are composed of tags and the content enclosed
between those tags.
